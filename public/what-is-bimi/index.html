        <h2 id="what-is-bimi">What is BIMI?</h2>
        <p>
          BIMI is an email standard that ties brand logos to strong email authentication. It is not an authentication
          protocol itself, but it depends on authentication being done correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When BIMI is set up properly, mailbox providers that support it may show your brand’s logo next to your
          messages in the inbox or message view. This only happens after the provider confirms that the email is
          authenticated and authorized by your domain.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In short, BIMI turns email authentication into a visible trust signal.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="why-bimi-exists">Why BIMI exists</h2>
        <p>
          Email spoofing is a persistent problem. Attackers routinely send messages that look like they come from
          well-known brands, banks, and online services. This hurts recipients, but it also hurts mailbox providers
          when users lose trust in their inbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          DMARC was created to stop this, but adoption has been slow. Many domains publish DMARC records without
          enforcing them, which limits their effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          BIMI was introduced as an incentive. If a brand enforces strong authentication, it becomes eligible to
          display its logo in supported inboxes. The logo is the reward, but the real benefit is stronger protection
          against spoofing.
        </p>

        <h2 id="requirements">Email authentication requirements</h2>
        <p>To be eligible for BIMI, a domain must already have email authentication in place:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SPF must be configured</li>
          <li>DKIM must be configured</li>
          <li>DMARC must be enforced</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          DMARC enforcement means using either <strong>p=quarantine</strong> or <strong>p=reject</strong>. A policy of
          <strong>p=none</strong> is not sufficient for BIMI, since it does not instruct mailbox providers to take
          action against unauthenticated mail.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bimi-record">What is a BIMI DNS record?</h2>
        <p>
          BIMI is enabled through a DNS TXT record, similar to SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. The BIMI record tells mailbox
          providers where to find your official logo file. The logo itself is hosted at a publicly accessible URL and
          referenced from DNS.
        </p>
        <p>At a high level, the record does one thing: it points to the SVG file that represents your brand.</p>
        <p>Publishing the BIMI record is typically one of the final steps, after authentication and logo preparation are complete.</p>

        <h2 id="svg-requirements">BIMI logos and SVG requirements</h2>
        <p>
          BIMI logos must be provided as SVG files using the <strong>SVG Tiny 1.2</strong> format. This format is
          intentionally restrictive and designed to be safe for email clients to render.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all existing SVGs are compatible. Logos often need to be simplified, flattened, and cleaned up to meet
          the specification. This is one of the most common stumbling blocks during BIMI setup.
        </p>

        <h2 id="vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</h2>
        <p>
          Some mailbox providers require a Verified Mark Certificate before displaying a BIMI logo. A VMC is a
          certificate that confirms the brand has legal rights to the logo being displayed. It is issued by an approved
          certificate authority and typically renewed annually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all mailbox providers require a VMC, but some use it as a strong signal of brand legitimacy. Whether a
          VMC is required depends on where your audience primarily reads email.
        </p>

        <h2 id="support">Which mailbox providers support BIMI?</h2>
        <p>
          BIMI support is growing, but it is not universal. Currently, BIMI is supported by several major mailbox
          providers, including Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, and Fastmail. Support in other clients may vary, and requirements
          such as VMCs differ by provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some widely used email clients do not yet display BIMI logos. That does not prevent you from implementing
          BIMI, but it is worth setting expectations internally about where logos will and will not appear.
        </p>

        <h2 id="setup">High-level BIMI setup process</h2>
        <p>At a high level, setting up BIMI involves the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify the domain used for sending email</li>
          <li>Confirm SPF and DKIM are working correctly</li>
          <li>Enforce DMARC with quarantine or reject</li>
          <li>Prepare a compliant SVG logo</li>
          <li>Obtain a VMC if required for your target inboxes</li>
          <li>Publish the BIMI DNS record</li>
          <li>Validate the configuration and wait for mailbox providers to process it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even after everything is correct, it can take time for logos to appear consistently.</p>

        <h2 id="deliverability">Does BIMI affect deliverability?</h2>
        <p>
          BIMI is not a deliverability feature by itself. Mailbox providers do not promise better inbox placement just
          because BIMI is present.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, BIMI depends on strong authentication and enforcement. Those factors do contribute to sender
          reputation and protection against abuse. Over time, that can indirectly support healthier deliverability.
        </p>
        <p>
          BIMI may also improve engagement. Recognizable logos can increase trust and help messages stand out, which can
          lead to higher open rates.
        </p>

        <h2 id="worth-it">Is BIMI worth it for your brand?</h2>
        <p>
          BIMI tends to be most valuable for brands that are frequently targeted by impersonation, such as financial
          services, large consumer brands, marketplaces, and SaaS platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smaller organizations can also benefit. Spoofing is not limited to big brands, and attackers often target
          smaller companies with weaker security controls.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you already have SPF, DKIM, and enforced DMARC, BIMI can be a logical next step. If you do not, those
          basics should come first.
        </p>

        <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
        <div class="faq" aria-label="Frequently asked questions about BIMI">
          <details>
            <summary>What is BIMI?</summary>
            <p>
              BIMI is an email standard that can display a brand’s verified logo in supported inboxes, but only after
              strong email authentication is in place and enforced.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What DMARC policy do you need for BIMI?</summary>
            <p>
              DMARC must be enforced with <strong>p=quarantine</strong> or <strong>p=reject</strong>. A policy of
              <strong>p=none</strong> is not sufficient for BIMI eligibility.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What format does a BIMI logo need to be?</summary>
            <p>
              BIMI logos must be an <strong>SVG Tiny 1.2</strong> file. Many SVGs need cleanup and simplification to
              meet the spec.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do you need a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC)?</summary>
            <p>
              Some mailbox providers require a VMC to display the logo. Whether you need one depends on where your
              audience reads email and which providers you care about most.

            <summary>Does BIMI improve deliverability?</summary>
            <p>
              BIMI is not a direct deliverability feature. It relies on strong authentication, which can indirectly
              support healthier sending practices over time.

        <p>
          The logo is the visible part of BIMI, but it is not the main point. BIMI exists to encourage better email
          authentication and protect recipients from fraud.

        <p>
          If your brand sends meaningful volumes of email and cares about trust, BIMI is worth understanding, even if
          you decide not to implement it right away.
